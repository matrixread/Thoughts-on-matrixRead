## How does it work

Giscus uses the GitHub Discussion API based on the page URL and creates a new discussion if it doesn't exist. To comment, visitors must authorize the giscus app to post on their behalf using the GitHub OAuth flow. Alternatively, visitors can comment directly on the GitHub Discussion. You can moderate the comments on GitHub.
